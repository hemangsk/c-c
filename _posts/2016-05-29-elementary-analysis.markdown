The definition of software is given as,

Software = Program <strong>+</strong> Documentation <strong>+</strong> Operating Procedures

Program is the <span class="udl">code</span> <i class="fa fa-code"></i>

Documentation is nothing but a bunch of <span class="udl">manuals</span> <i class="fa fa-file"></i>

Operating Procedures are also nothing but <span class="udl">a bunch of manuals</span> <i class="fa fa-file"></i>

The engineering branch which deals with all the inner and outer aspects of software production is called <span class="udl">Software Engineering</span>.
