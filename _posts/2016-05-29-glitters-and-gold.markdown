Software Industry = Software Company's Management + Customers + Developers

Software Company's Management are the people who <span class="udl">manage the process of software development</span>.

Customers are the ones <span class="udl">for whom the software is being developed</span>.

Developers are the people <span class="udl">who develop the software</span>.
<br><br><br>
<span class="ddl"><em>The biggest myths which the management believes are,</em></span>

<li>Our company has perfect standard and clear procedures.</li> <span class="cmnt">Dude! You gotta come see the cabins!</span>
<li>Our company has excellent infrastructure. Thus the software's gonna be great!</li><span class="cmnt"> Yeah we'll see.</span>
<li>If we hire more software specialists, we can catch up with the timeline.</li><span class="cmnt">Chances are, that this new hiring might delay it more.</span>
<li>Software is easy to change!</li> <span class="cmnt">Duh!</span>
<br><br>
<span class="ddl"><em>The myths which the customers believe are,</em></span>

<li>A general statement of objectives is sufficient to
  get started with the development of software. Missing/vague requirements
  can easily be incorporated/detailed out as they get concretized.</li> <span class="cmnt">Betcha don't want a good software!</span>
<li>Software with more features is better software</li><span class="cmnt">Nope!</span>
<li>Software can work right the first time</li><span class="cmnt">Neither.</span>
<br><br>
<span class="ddl"><em>The myths which the developers believe are,</em></span>

<li>Software demonstrated, job's done!</li><span class="cmnt">Not yet! The job's also to optimize it.</span>
<li>Software quality can not be assessed before testing.</li><span class="cmnt"> It can be done and it should be done.</span>


The study of Software engineering tells us why these myths are myths, And what is the correct approach of doing things.
